📢 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification Project

This Jupyter Notebook implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model to predict a binary target class from an unknown dataset. 
The notebook includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) , feature preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using popular Python libraries.

The goal is to determine whether a data point belongs to one of two categories based on its features using the KNN algorithm , 
and to find the best value of k that gives the most accurate predictions.

 📊 Dataset

This dataset contains numerical features which are labeled and a binary TARGET CLASS column indicating the outcome or category for each observation.
Data Set available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nitya1510/knn-project-data


 🔍 Features

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
✅ Feature scaling using StandardScaler for better KNN performance
✅ Train/Test split and model training using KNeighborsClassifier
✅ Evaluation metrics : Confusion matrix, classification report, accuracy score
✅ Hyperparameter tuning : Using the Elbow Method to select the optimal k value
💡 Insights into how different features influence the prediction of the target class
 🛠️ How to Use

Clone this repository
Download the dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nitya1510/knn-project-data) and place it in the project folder
Install required packages : pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, and seaborn
Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook
Run the cells to:
Explore the data visually
Preprocess and scale the features
Train and evaluate the KNN model
Tune k values using error rate analysis
 
 🧠 Tips & Notes

KNN is sensitive to feature scales , so we use StandardScaler before modeling
The Elbow Method helps choose the best k by minimizing error
Since the dataset has no descriptive feature names, we work with columns like X1, X2, etc.
This is a great example of working with real-world unlabeled datasets
